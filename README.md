# Book-Store

Book Store Backend API

The bookstore design decisions were made based on the project requirement document,  C#, and Asp.Net was used to build the REST API to handle the bookstore operations.

MSQL database was used to manage data locally in my machine for development purpose, which can also be used in production.

The database schema was designed to match a current online bookstore standard, which performs basic CRUD and also, a cart functionality which allows users to add books and book quantity to their cart, and complete the order.

SimpleJWT was used for authentication and authorization to handle security which is a crucial part of the website as users' security is vital.

Scalability was also considered during the development so the codebase could easily be maintained and managed by other developers, and documentation was included where needed.
